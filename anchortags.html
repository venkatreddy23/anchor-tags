    <p>What is a Programming language?</p>
    <h5><a href="">formal system of instructions</a>A programming language is a  used to communicate with a
computer</h5>
        <h5>Enables developers to <a href="">write programs for various tasks</a> such as web development, data
analysis, and automation.
</h5>
<p>Why Python?</p>
<p><a href="">Ease of Use: Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.</a><br>
Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural,
functional).</p>
<p>Extensive Libraries: Rich ecosystem for tasks like <a href="">data analysis, machine learning, and web
development.</a> <br>
4. Community Support: Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.<br>
5. Interpreted Language: Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.<br></p>
<p>What is Python?</p>
<h4>Python is a high-level, <a href="">interpreted programming language</a>  known for its simplicity and
readability. It was created by <a href=""> Guido van Rossum</a> in the late 1980s and first released in 1991.
